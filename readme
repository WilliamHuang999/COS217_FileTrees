Student 1: What is your name?

George Tziampazis

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your name?

Will Huang

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 1: What authorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of
information given in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab
in the file ~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the
readme file, and edit it as appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

A lot of work but useful for learning how to understand and edit
existing codebase


------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        BDT_insert()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        BDT_freeSubtree()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        BDT_addChild()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4        BDT_strlenAccumulate()
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5        BDT_findNode()
===============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

nodeDT.h and nodeDTGood.c critiques
      - Argument names in Node_compare() should match the convention set
      in Path_comparePath() in path.h, recommend to change argument
      names to onNode1 and onNode2.
      - Node_toString() is declared and defined but doesn't seem to be
	used anywhere. It could potentially be used in
	DT_strcatAccumulate().
      - In Node_new(), the variable psNew is declared as a struct node*.
	For consistency and understandability, it should be declared as
	a Node_T even though they're essentially the same thing.
	Additionally, if it's declared as a Node_T, the name should be
	changed to oNNew.

dt.h and dtGood.c critiques
      - For DT_strcatAccumulate(), there's no clear reason to invert the
	typical argument order from strcat. This inversion could
	potentially be confusing. Argument order should match strcat.
      - In DT_contains(), the node oNFound is not really used. It is
      passed as a parameter to DT_findNode. If the node with path pcPath
      is found, oNFound is set to the corresponding node. If the node
	isn't found, oNFound is set to NULL. However, oNFound is
	ultimately never returned or used for anything, so the client
	can't access it.
      - DT_contains() seems unneccessary especially since DT_findNode()
      already exists (despite it being a static function) and will also
      tell the client if the node exists.

Path.h and Path.c critiques
      - Path_dup() seems unnecessary. It is only called once in
	nodeDTGood.c. Furthermore, looking at its definition, the
	calling of Path_dup() could easily be replaced by calling
	Path_prefix() instead.

General critiques
      - There should be more line comments within functions in all the
	modules to explain the relevant logic. Reading the code is
	confusing at times without comments. For example, DT_rm() has no
	line comments at all.
